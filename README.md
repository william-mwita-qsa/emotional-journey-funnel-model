## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to **model, simulate, and understand the emotional and behavioral journey** of customers as they move through a marketing funnel — from **awareness to loyalty or churn**.

Using **R**, **Bayesian thinking**, and **systems modeling**, this solution is built as a fully modular, scalable behavioral system — empowering brands to:

- Decode customer emotion at each stage  
- Predict churn or conversion before it happens  
- Visualize friction, doubt, trust, urgency, and confusion  
- Simulate and test intervention strategies  

> **Goal:** Deliver a working system for African and global brands to turn invisible behavior into visible signals — and to win the emotional battle of customer retention.

## 🧠 Why This Matters (Real-World Relevance)

💡 Companies lose billions annually due to **emotional blind spots** in their marketing funnels. This system bridges that gap by:

- Mapping behavior **from signal to decision**  
- Making **emotion measurable and visual**  
- Forecasting churn and delays through **Bayesian simulation**  
- Redesigning funnels based on **customer system maps**  

This is not just analysis — it’s behavioral system design for real sales intelligence.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Clone the repository and open in RStudio  
2. Run `00_project_setup.R` to initialize folders (if not yet created)  
3. Use `report.Rmd` to simulate journeys and visualize emotional patterns  
4. Drop your feedback or CRM files into `02_data/`  
5. Tune model parameters inside `04_scripts/`, export scored leads via `07_output/`

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Integrate real-time CRM pipelines (e.g. Hubspot, Zoho, Salesforce)
- Build a **Shiny dashboard** for real-time behavioral signal monitoring  
- Add a **journey classifier** trained on paths + text  
- Deploy the system as a **B2B SaaS behavioral insight engine** under Gitweno Nexus
