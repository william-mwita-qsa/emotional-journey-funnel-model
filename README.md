## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to **model, simulate, and understand the emotional and behavioral journey** of customers as they move through a marketing funnel — from **awareness to loyalty or churn**. Using **R**, Bayesian thinking, and systems modeling, this project combines:
- **Quantitative simulation**
- **Text-based emotion analysis**
- **State transition modeling**
- **Customer decision prediction**

> **Goal:** To build a scalable behavioral system that empowers brands to decode customer emotion, optimize funnel transitions, and anticipate churn — all from structured and unstructured data.

## 🧠 Why This Matters (Real-World Relevance)

💡 Brands lose billions annually due to **invisible emotional friction** and poorly understood behavior in their marketing systems. This model seeks to **bridge that intelligence gap** by:

- Making **customer emotion visible** using data
- Simulating **how trust, doubt, urgency, or confusion** evolve at each funnel stage
- Mapping **feedback loops and decision delays**
- Helping teams **redesign interventions** based on simulated and predictive models

## 🧪 Core Features

| Module                      | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **📊 Funnel Simulation**     | Simulated customer movement across awareness → loyalty stages |
| **📉 Churn Prediction**      | Bayesian regression on emotional cues to anticipate exit behavior |
| **💬 Sentiment Extraction**  | NLP-driven emotional profiling from customer feedback |
| **🔁 System Thinking Engine**| Causal loop diagrams, Markov Chains, and delay dynamics |
| **📈 Visualization Layer**   | ggplot2 + plotly + ggraph to make insights executive-ready |

## 📦 Core R Packages Used

- `tidyverse` – Core wrangling and pipeline logic
- `brms`, `rstanarm` – Bayesian modeling of churn and behavior
- `markovchain`, `simmer` – Funnel simulation + system dynamics
- `tidytext`, `syuzhet` – Emotional mining from customer feedback
- `ggraph`, `plotly`, `ggplot2` – High-quality storytelling and system visualization
- `broom`, `janitor`, `lubridate` – Tidy analysis and real-world data cleanup

## 🧭 How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**
2. Run `report.Rmd` to simulate customer journeys, extract emotions, and generate insights
3. Plug in your **own CRM or feedback data** into `data/`
4. Use the modeling scripts to **forecast behavior**, detect system blockages, or redesign your funnel

---

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

- Integrate with a **live API or CRM feedback stream**
- Convert into a **Shiny dashboard** for real-time behavioral intelligence
- Train a **customer journey classifier** using text + path data
- Deploy as a **SaaS behavioral insight engine** for African SMEs
